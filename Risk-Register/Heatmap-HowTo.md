# Risk Heat Map – How To

## Purpose
A risk heat map visually represents risk severity based on likelihood and impact scores. It is commonly used in GRC reporting to help leadership quickly understand risk exposure.

## Steps (Excel or Google Sheets)
1. Assign **Likelihood (1–5)** and **Impact (1–5)** scores to each risk.
2. Calculate **Risk Score** using:

   3. Create a 5×5 table:
- Rows = Likelihood
- Columns = Impact
4. Use conditional formatting:
- Low (1–5): Green
- Medium (6–12): Yellow
- High (15–25): Red
5. Use COUNTIFS formulas to populate each cell.

## Usage
Heat maps are typically reviewed during:
- Risk review meetings
- Quarterly risk assessments
- Audit and compliance updates
