# Risk Register (GRC Core Artifact)

## Purpose
A risk register is a foundational Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) artifact used to identify, assess, prioritize, and track cybersecurity and operational risks. This example is modeled after a small-to-mid-size SaaS organization.

## Methodology
Risks are evaluated using a qualitative risk scoring approach:

- **Likelihood (1–5):** Probability of the risk occurring
- **Impact (1–5):** Business and security impact if the risk materializes
- **Inherent Risk:** Likelihood × Impact (before controls)
- **Residual Risk:** Remaining risk after mitigation

## Key Risk Elements
Each risk includes:
- Asset or process at risk
- Threat and associated vulnerability
- Existing controls
- Risk treatment decision (Mitigate, Transfer, Avoid, Accept)
- Mitigation plan and ownership
- Target remediation date and status

## Artifacts Included
- **Risk-Register-SaaS-Example.csv:** Sample populated risk register
- **Heatmap-HowTo.md:** Guidance for building a risk heat map using Excel or Google Sheets

This approach aligns with common expectations in frameworks such as NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and SOC 2.
