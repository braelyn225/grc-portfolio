# SOC 2 Control Mapping (Sample)

## Purpose
Control mapping links SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria to internal policies, procedures, and technical controls.

## Sample Control Mapping

| SOC 2 Criteria | Control Description | Evidence |
|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| CC1.1 | Information security policies are approved and communicated | Information Security Policy |
| CC2.1 | Roles and responsibilities are defined | Access Control Policy |
| CC5.2 | Logical access is restricted | IAM configuration, MFA screenshots |
| CC6.1 | Access provisioning and deprovisioning is managed | Access review records |
| CC7.2 | Security incidents are detected and responded to | Incident Response Plan, tickets |

## Notes
This mapping demonstrates how non-technical and technical controls work together to satisfy SOC 2 requirements.
