# Evidence Collection Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook outlines a structured approach for collecting, validating, and storing audit evidence.

## Evidence Types
- Policies and procedures
- System configuration screenshots
- Access reviews and logs
- Change management records
- Incident tickets

## Evidence Collection Guidelines
- Evidence must be accurate, complete, and time-bound
- Screenshots should include timestamps where possible
- Files should be read-only once submitted
- Evidence should be mapped to specific controls

## Storage
Evidence is stored in a centralized, access-controlled repository with retention aligned to audit requirements.
