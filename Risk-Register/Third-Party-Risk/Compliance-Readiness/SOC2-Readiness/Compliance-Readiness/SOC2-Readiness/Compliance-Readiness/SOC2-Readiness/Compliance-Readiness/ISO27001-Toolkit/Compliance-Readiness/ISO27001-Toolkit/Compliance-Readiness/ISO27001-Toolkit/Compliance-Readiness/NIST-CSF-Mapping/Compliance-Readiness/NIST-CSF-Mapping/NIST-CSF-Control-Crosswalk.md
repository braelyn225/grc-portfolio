# NIST CSF Control Crosswalk (Sample)

## Purpose
This crosswalk demonstrates how NIST CSF functions align with internal controls, policies, and procedures.

## Sample Mapping

| NIST CSF Function | Category | Example Control | Related Artifact |
|------------------|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Identify | ID.AM | Asset inventory maintained | Risk Register |
| Identify | ID.RA | Risk assessments conducted | Risk Register |
| Protect | PR.AC | Logical access controls | Access Control Policy |
| Protect | PR.AT | Security awareness training | Security Awareness Training |
| Detect | DE.CM | Continuous monitoring | Logging & alerting procedures |
| Respond | RS.RP | Incident response planning | Incident Response Plan |
| Recover | RC.RP | Recovery planning | Backup & DR documentation |

## Notes
Crosswalks help organizations demonstrate how controls satisfy multiple frameworks without duplicating effort.
