# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Mapping

## Purpose
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) provides a flexible, risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity risk. It is widely used across U.S. public and private sector organizations.

This folder demonstrates high-level control mapping using the NIST CSF to support risk management and compliance activities.

## NIST CSF Core Functions
- **Identify:** Asset management, governance, risk assessment
- **Protect:** Access control, awareness, data security
- **Detect:** Monitoring and detection processes
- **Respond:** Incident response and communications
- **Recover:** Recovery planning and improvements

## Artifact Included
- **NIST-CSF-Control-Crosswalk.md:** Mapping between NIST CSF functions and common GRC artifacts

This mapping approach is commonly used to align security programs with business risk.
