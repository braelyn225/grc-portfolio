# Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)

## Purpose
Third-party risk management is a core GRC function focused on identifying, assessing, and managing risks introduced by vendors, suppliers, and service providers that have access to company systems or data.

This example models a lightweight TPRM program suitable for a small-to-mid-size organization or SaaS environment.

## Scope
Third-party risks may include:
- Data security and privacy risks
- Availability and business continuity risks
- Regulatory and compliance risks
- Concentration and dependency risks

## Approach
Vendors are assessed using:
- Risk-based scoping (critical vs non-critical vendors)
- Security questionnaires
- Review of third-party audit reports (SOC 1 / SOC 2)
- Contractual security requirements

## Artifacts Included
- **Vendor-Risk-Questionnaire.md:** Sample security questionnaire
- **Vendor-Risk-Scoring-Model.md:** Vendor risk scoring methodology

This process aligns with expectations in SOC 2, ISO 27001, and NIST CSF.
