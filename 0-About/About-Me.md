# About Me

I am an aspiring Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) professional with a strong interest in cybersecurity risk management, compliance readiness, and security governance. This portfolio demonstrates hands-on experience with risk assessments, control mapping, policy development, and audit-style documentation.

## Focus Areas
- Cybersecurity risk assessments and risk registers
- SOC 2 and ISO 27001 readiness
- Third-party risk management (TPRM)
- Security policies and audit evidence collection
- Translating technical risk into business language

This repository contains educational, portfolio-based examples modeled after real-world GRC workflows used in enterprise and SaaS environments.
