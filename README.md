# GRC Portfolio

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

**A comprehensive Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) portfolio showcasing hands-on experience with cybersecurity risk management, compliance frameworks, and audit documentation.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This portfolio demonstrates practical GRC skills through real-world artifacts modeled after enterprise and SaaS security programs. It serves as a learning resource and professional showcase for cybersecurity risk assessment, compliance readiness, policy development, and audit evidence management.

**Context:** This is self-directed educational work designed to build and demonstrate GRC competency aligned with industry standards including ISO 27001, SOC 2, and NIST CSF.
